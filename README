Simple bash script to automatically create the following..

1. hosts file entry (.local)
2. creates a directory in /var/www/
3. copies a pre-configured vhost to /etc/apache2/sites-available
4. enables the site, restarting apache

All you need to do is then run sh autosite.sh or set an alias up for it.

I know it doesnt take long to do the following, however all those 5 min jobs add up.
